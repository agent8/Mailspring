Edit and Delete feature
Create calendar without database first
    - user logs in and calendar will display the intended information
    - information is transient, and will disappear on reload

Bugs TODOs
parser - fetching event with no end dates has bug —> variable ‘until’ in Caldav calendar data is undefined in this case and recurrence expansion is empty
parser - Caldav parser can be less complicated to improve speed
AddForm - Might have to change how data of add event is being displayed on calendar - currently the calendar UI is refreshed by pulling from server again after pushing event to server, but this causes UI to display too slowly.
				- Original intention was to add the event data to reflux directly, but the object data differs too widely from the one pulled from server, 
				   might need another set of helper functions to specifically delete/edit the event object that is created locally instead of pulled from server.
calendar-plugin-store logic right now can only store 1 account/calendar/calendardata per provider, meaning 1 iCloud, 1 google, 1 EWS account. 
		       	- Can extend to store more than 1, by linking each auth details with corresponding calendar/calendardata
AddForm - no clock display for user when adjusting date time
AddForm - date changes when adjusting recurrence options
